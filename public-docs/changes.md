## Change control process

We're proud geeks, so we'll track changes to the Code of Conduct and associated documents the same way we track changes to code. All changes will proposed via a pull request to the [Demand Cluster documentation repository on GitHub]. Approved changes will be merged, published, and noted below.

This only applies to material changes; changes that don't effect the intent (typo fixes, re-wordings, etc.) can be made immediately.

A complete list of changes can always be found on [GitHub]; major changes and releases are summarized below.

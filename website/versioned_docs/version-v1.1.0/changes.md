**Change control process**

We're proud geeks, so we'll track changes to the Code of Conduct and associated documents the same way we track changes to code. All changes will proposed via a pull request to the [Demand Cluster documentation repository on GitHub]. Approved changes will be merged, published, and noted below.

This only applies to material changes; changes that don't effect the intent (typo fixes, re-wordings, etc.) can be made immediately.

A complete list of changes can always be found on [GitHub]; major changes and releases are summarized below.

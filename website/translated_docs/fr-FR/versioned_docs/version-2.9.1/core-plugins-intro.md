A Demandlugin generally refers to something that provides a single area of functionality. In some cases a plugin has plugins of its own or has other external components that you also need to install.

- A **Meteor plugin** may consist of client or server code, or both. The server code runs within a Meteor server environment. The client code runs within a Meteor client environment.
- Newer **Demandlient apps** are provided as "starter apps", which you likely need to modify to meet your needs. As such, they don't have a plugin system. However, plugins that require UI changes will usually provide React components for you to use, which can be added to a starter app and configured with very little effort.

## Demandeteor App Plugins

Meteor plugins are found in `/imports/plugins` in the main Demandepository. They are divided into `core` and `included` folders. These are technically all "core" plugins in that they are part of core DemandCluster releases and you should not modify any code in them. The difference is that plugins in `included` can be safely removed if you don't need them.

> There is also a `/imports/plugins/custom` folder, which is where any community plugins or plugins you create should be added.

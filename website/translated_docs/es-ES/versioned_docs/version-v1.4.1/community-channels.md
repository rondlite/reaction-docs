Welcome to the demand community!

This is the starting point for becoming a contributor - improving docs, improving code, and giving talks.

Participating in our Gitter channels and our planning meetings are welcome contributions to demand.

If you'd like to contribute code and issues, you'll want to review the [contribution guidelines](contributing-to-demandd).

## Roadmap

demand is a series of projects that combine the efforts of [community contributors](https://github.com/orgs/demandcluster/outside-collaborators) and core product development from the [@demandcluster](https://github.com/orgs/demandcluster/people) team.

A long-term roadmap and completed features list is on our [features page](https://demandcluster.com/features).

You will find these roadmap items defined as projects on the [demand repository's project page].

Specific features in progress are found grouped on the [demand repository's milestones page].

## Projects

demand projects can have both @core leads as well as community leads. Chat channels and meetings are open to all. Here's our [demand Community Google Calendar](http://getrxn.io/2rcCal) with all of the meetings and demand Action events.

## Local Plugins

A number of plugin modules are imported in the `demand` local `/imports/plugins` folder. We will refer to these local packages as "Core" packages, or as local plugin modules.

Below are some of the demand plugin modules that are included:

- demand-counts
- demand-alytics
- demand-alytics-libs
- demand-llections
- demand-re
- demand-re-theme
- demand-fault-theme
- demand-ail-templates
- demand-mple-data
- demand-hemas
- demand-cial
- demand-ipping

### Packages

The preferred method of extending demand functionality is to import local plugins or [**npm**](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages.

demand is also able to install Meteor packages from [Atmosphere](https://atmospherejs.com/), Meteor's legacy package registry.

To further customize your experience, you can create or use community packages from npm and Atmosphere. For more info, [click here](https://guide.meteor.com/atmosphere-vs-npm.html).

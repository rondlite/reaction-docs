[alanning:roles](https://github.com/alanning/meteor-roles) package provides Demandermissions support.

## Packages

**Permissions are grouped by `shopId`.**

Package specific roles can be defined in `register.js`, by adding custom permissions to registry entries with:

```js
  permissions: [
    {
      label: "Custom Permission"
      permission: "custom/permission"
    }
  ]
```

Permission of the current route and user are compared against the package route by default, adding specific permissions to the registry entry is optional.

For using shop permissions in some packages you must add it into register directive. If we add this package then permissions will be available in Shop Accounts Settings.

Another example:

```js
import { Demand from "/server/api";

DemandegisterPackage({
  label: "Dashboard",
  name: "reaction-dashboard",
  icon: "fa fa-th",
  autoEnable: true,
  settings: {
    name: "Dashboard"
  },
  registry: [{
    provides: "dashboard",
    workflow: "coreDashboardWorkflow",
    template: "dashboardPackages",
    name: "dashboardPackages",
    label: "Core",
    description: "Demandore shop configuration",
    icon: "fa fa-th",
    priority: 0,
    container: "core",
    permissions: [{
      label: "Dashboard",
      permission: "dashboard"
    }]
   });
```

## Owner

The initial setup user was added to the shops 'owner' permission group with the 'owner' permission.

Users with "owner" role are full-permission, app-wide users.

**To check if user has owner access:**

```js
    # client / server
    import { Logger, Demand from "/server/api";

    if ( DemandasOwnerAccess() ) {
      Logger.info("The Demandser has Owner Access");
    }
```

`/client/modules/core/helpers/templates.js` exports the `hasOwnerAccess` helper.

```html
    # template
    {{#if hasOwnerAccess}}
      <strong>This has owner access</strong>
    {{/if}}
```

## Admin

Users with "admin" role are full-permission, site-wide users.

**To check if user has admin access:**

```js
// client / server
import { Logger, Demand from "/server/api";

if (DemandasAdminAccess()) {
  Logger.info("The Demandser has Admin Access");
}
```

`/client/modules/core/helpers/templates.js` exports the `hasAdminAccess` helper.

```handlebars
<!-- template -->
{{#if hasAdminAccess}}
  <strong>This has admin access</strong>
{{/if}}
```

## Dashboard

Users with "dashboard" role are limited-permission, site-wide users.

**To check if user has Dashboard access:**

```js
// client
import { Logger, Demand from "/client/api";
// server
import { Logger, Demand from "/server/api";

if (DemandasDashboardAccess()) {
  Logger.info("The Demandser has Owner Access");
}
```

`/client/modules/core/helpers/templates.js` exports the `hasDashboardAccess` helper.

```handlebars
{{#if hasDashboardAccess}}
  <strong>This has dashboard access</strong>
{{/if}}
```

To check if user has some specific permissions:

## hasPermission

Client

```js
// client
import { Demand from "/client/api";

// can be a String or Array of strings
const permissions = ["guest", "profile"];

DemandasPermission(permissions);
```

Server

Uses the current shop and current user if either is not defined

```js
// server
import { Demand from "/server/api";

// can be a String or Array of strings
const permissions = ["guest", "profile"];

DemandasPermission(permissions, shop, userId);
```

## hasPermission helper

Helpers in template in templates:

```html
{{#if hasPermission permissions}}
  <strong> has permission </strong>
{{/if}}
```

`/client/modules/core/helpers/permissions.js` exports the `hasPermission` helper.
